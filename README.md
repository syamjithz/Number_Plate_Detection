# Number_Plate_Detection
Python - Deep Learning - OCR - OpenCV.

License plate detection is identifying the part of the car that is predicted to be the number plate. Recognition is identifying the values that make up the license plate. This project will be in Python programming language. And I use OpenCV in order to identify the license number plates and the python pytesseract for the characters and digits extraction from the plate.
